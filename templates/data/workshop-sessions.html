      , 'blurb'       : 'Android NDK provides a powerful set of tools to build and run native code in Android apps. Often times, an Andorid app will need to execute code written in such native code languages like C/C++ for doing some computationally intensive tasks or for simply reusing code libraries written in these languages. In this workshop, Naman will be talking about setting up the NDK and how to port existing softwares written in C/C++ to Android and Java.'
