OkHttp is the android client of SPYDY. There is very less documentation around Volley, hence the objective is to become aware of how to use Volley and customize it along with OkHttp.</p><p>Http is the modern protocol of network applications. The presentation starts with introduction of OkHttp library (which is an HTTP &amp; SPDY client for Android and Java applications) and Volley library (which is fast, easy async and caching framework for network calls, used by PlayStore). Then, we will walk through detail hands-on of how it works, common patterns that work well with them, and how to use the libraries and build easy, fast android applications. It will cover a comparison of tasks and amount of code of Async tasks you need to write before Volley and after you have these framework.Then, You will learn to build a sample application that have both OkHttp and Volley together and run a Rest based client to call a JSON response. We will deep dive in caching framework of Volley and touch upon image loading framework and caching of the same. This will be along with a walk-through of how you can load images from network in parallel in ListView. We\'ll conclude by discussing how to build an app with Volley and OkHttp or port your app to Volley.</p>'
